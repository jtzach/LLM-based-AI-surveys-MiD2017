Naive Method. 
I want you to create a synthetic population of Germany 2017. You will create an excel of the synthetic population. Every row will represent a candidate. 
Attributes of the population are:
Age Group
	14 to 17 years
	18 to 29 years
	30 to 39 years
	40 to 49 years
	50 to 59 years
	60 to 64 years
	65 to 74 years
	75 to 79 years
	80 years and older
Education Level
	no degree (yet)
	low
	medium
	high
Main Activity
	full-time employee (including trainees)
	part-time employee (11 to 35 hours per week)

I want an educated guess about how german population in 2017 would look like.
Keep in mind that the attributes of each individual person are correlated.
For example the "Household Type" and "Age Group" are related.
